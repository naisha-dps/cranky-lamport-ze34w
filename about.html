          Saturday Night Live (also known as SNL) is an American late-night live
          television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels
          and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiere was hosted by George
          Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's
          Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody
          contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and
          varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is
          hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening
          monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured
          performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a
          cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and
          proclaiming, "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!", properly
          beginning the show.

          Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is hosting Saturday Night Live this
          week. He’s coming in fresh from Wednesday’s successful Starship
          prototype landing but also on the heels of recent customer complaints
          about Tesla’s Solar Roof costs and last month’s deadly Tesla crash. If
          you have the desire to spend part of your Saturday finding out if the
          self-proclaimed Technoking makes a good comedy show host, here are the
          details-
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>HOW DO I WATCH?</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          SNL airs on NBC, and it’s available to watch on the NBC website if you
          have a cable login. It will also be available on other live TV
          streaming services like Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and
          Fubo TV. If you don’t catch it live, SNL episodes are available on
          Hulu and Peacock the next day.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>WHEN DOES IT START?</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          It starts at 11:30PM ET on May 8th, which is — you guessed it —
          Saturday night.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>WHAT WILL HAPPEN?</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Miley Cyrus will be performing. Beyond that, who knows! Perhaps Musk
          will make a bunch of references to Dogecoin, do a skit where he
          re-creates the faces he pulled while smoking weed, or joke about
          rockets catching fire. Maybe his Twitter charisma won’t quite carry
          over, or maybe he’ll shock us with a surprisingly good delivery of a
          witty monologue. It remains to be seen, but either way, I’m sure we’ll
          hear all about it on Twitter.
