        <h2>
          Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable
          energy. Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted
          to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric –
          that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive
          than gasoline cars.
          <br />
          Tesla, Inc’s mission and vision statements both share the company’s
          organizational objective of leading the world to sustainable energy
          consumption. A group of engineers founded Tesla in 2003 with the sole
          purpose of proving that we don’t have to sacrifice any benefits when
          we choose electric cars over conventionally fueled cars. Today, in
          2021, it would be an understatement to say that electric cars are just
          as good as conventionally fueled cars, if not better. All thanks to
          Tesla, Inc. for moving forward with its goal.

            Which means that Tesla’s cars are very fast and they do not use oil.
